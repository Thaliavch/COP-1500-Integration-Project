 The objective of this program is to  help Registered Behavior Technicians
 during a session with a client.
 An RBT needs to employ tools in order to asses behavior, among this tools
 there are graphs, data sheets, a timer and a notepad.
 The goal is to put all this tools in one application so it is easier for the
 technician to complete a task,
 and to provide feedback to the technician after a session.
